# Game-Web-Application
A web application that hosts Pong, Worlde, and Tetris. It also has insightful tips and tricks for each respective game. 

To play: RUN the file called : labTesting

The web application relies on relative paths, so please put all the files in the same directory/folder. Alternatively, you can choose to run each of the three games independently without using the web application. 

Have FUN!
